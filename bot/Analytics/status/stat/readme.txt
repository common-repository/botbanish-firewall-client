 Access Stats allows you to keep track of activities on your web site.
 It extracts some statistic from a log file generated by log.pl.
 These reports are generated by Access Stats:

 - Visits by day
 - Visits by hour
 - Visits by week-day
 - Referer
 - Browser
 - Operating System
 - Countries
 - Hostnames

 1.Open stat.pl and log.pl with a text editor.
   Change the url in line one, to the Perl program at your server.
   Usually it is: - /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl for Unix.
                  - C:/Perl/Perl.exe for Windows (use slash "/")
   Set the correct paths and required urls.

 2.Upload stat.pl and log.pl in ASCII-mode to your cgi-bin directory
   and change mode it to 755 (-rwxr-xr-x).

 3.To track your site insert this script to your html document.
   
  Javascript:
   <script language="JavaScript">
   <!--
   document.write("<img src=\"http://www.host.com/cgi-bin/log.pl?ref="+top.document.referrer+"\" width=16 height=16 border=0>");
   //-->
   </script>
   <noscript>
   <img src="http://www.host.com/cgi-bin/log.pl?ref=noscript" width=16 height=16 border=0>
   </noscript>
   
  SSI:
   <img src="http://www.host.com/cgi-bin/log.pl?ref=<!--#echo var="HTTP_REFERER"-->" width=16 height=16 border=0>

   - A new log file is generated every month.
